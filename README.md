This is I-Ting's lab_notes serving as the central for both an electronic lab notebook (ELN - built using Jekyll, pages can be found under "main", organized by date) and as the repository for the miscellaneous scripts/protocols/useful one-liners that is becoming increasingly common in work. Currently under construction, perhaps organize by project in future.
